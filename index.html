        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <h3>Forecasting of Hospital Patient Capacity</h3>
        <p>Master dissertation project looking at forecasting hospital ward patient capacity in Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh based on transition log data. The project outcome was a prediction visualization tool that would be used by hospital staff to plan ahead. An accuracy of 97% was achieved by developing and comparing advanced machine learning forecasting methods and making this process easily reproducible for future updates in the developed tool</p>
    
        <h3>Modelling of the Spread of Infectious Diseases</h3>
        <p>Bachelor dissertation project that involved modelling how during an outbreak people move between three classes: susceptible, infected and recovered. The project outlined critical factors that determine disease propagation patterns through a population. The SIRS model for this project was built in Python, the report was written using Latex and a final presentation was given in front of university associates</p>
    
        <h3>Mathematical research of Vaccine Scares</h3>
        <p>A group project which provided analytical insight on modern methods of modelling the number of patients and the vaccinated part of the population. The project development took place over three weeks, we cooperated as a team and completed a Latex report and delivered a presentation on our findings</p>
    
        <h3>Recipe Finder Website</h3>
        <p>As a team leader of six people, our team created a website that recommends recipes by considering the ingredients available. This project involved web scraping, text processing, machine learning, web development skills and organization skills</p>
