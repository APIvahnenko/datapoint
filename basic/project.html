        Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel
        quite sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all
        this nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do
        because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state
        couldn't get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto
        his right, he always rolled back to where he was.

      Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own
      business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of travelling,

      with different people all the time so that you can never get to know
      anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!
